				Now that you know about all the GameMaker's different variable types, it is time to test if
				you actually understood them properly.

				I offer you this small test which you need to pass to unlock the next lesson. I can't let you
				continue if you don't understand variables because they are the very basics you need to be able

				To pass an exercice, you need to have 100% answers right.
				The answers <i>will not be given</i> and the <i>errors will not be shown</i>.
				Make sure you study carefully the lessons and then try to complete the exercices!
				Don't worry, I will <i>never</i> make "bonus" questions that needs special knowledge.
				The test are here to help you, not to make your life harder.

			<p class="message-body">
				Most exercices will be multiple choices questions, but sometimes I will include some
				coding boxes where you can do whatever you like, as long as it produces the right answer.
				For this exercice though, there are only multiple choices questions.
